<br><button onclick="myFunction('myDIV')">Pre War</button>
<div id="myDIV">He was generally thought of by his peers as a womaniser, a cheat and a lier.  But his story is much more complex than that he was born in 28 April 1908 in Zwittau Moravia in Czechoslovakia to a wealthy family that owned a Farm Machinery business. after attending Primary and High School Oskar went to a Technical School which he got expelled from for forging a report card but did later graduate but did not sit the Abitur exam so he did not go to university. Instead went to do trade skills Brno (Czech Republic). In 1928 he got married to Emilie Pielzi and even joined the Czech army on a 18 month stint.
Oskar then joined the separatist Sudeten German Party in 1935. Even though he was a Czech citizen, Oskar became a spy for the Abwehr, an intelligence service of Nazi Germany, in 1936. He was assigned to Abwehr Stelle II Commando VIII, based in Breslau. He  told Czech police that he did it because he needed the money; by this time Schindler had a drinking problem and was chronically in debt.
</div>
<br><button onclick="myFunction('secondDiv')">During War</button>
<br><br><div id="secondDiv">Schindler was introduced to Itzhak Stern, a bookkeeper for Oskars friend Josef Aue, who had taken over Stern's formerly Jewish-owned place of employment as a manager. Anything belonging to Polish Jews, even their property were taken by the Nazis after the invasion, and Jews were stripped of their rights. Oskar showed Itzhak the books he was thinking of acquiring, a pots and pan factory that was owned by jews. Itzhak advised him that rather than running the company as a trusteeship under the auspices of the Haupttreuhandstelle Ost (Main Trustee Office for the East), he should buy the company. that would give him more freedom from the dictates of the Nazis, including the freedom to hire more Jews.<br> As the USSR advanced in 1994, the SS began closing down the eastern concentration camps and moving the remaining jews to Auschwitz and Gross-Rosen concentration camp. Goth's secretary, Mietek Pemper alerted Oskar to the Nazis plans to close all factories not directly involved in the war , including Oskar’s Pots and pans factory. Mietek suggested to Oskar that production should be switched from cookware to anti-tank grenades in an effort to save the lives of the Jewish workers. Using bribery and his powers of persuasion, Schindler convinced Göth and the officials in Berlin to allow him to move his factory and his workers to Brünnlitz (Czech:, in the Sudetenland.) Sparing them from death in the gas chambers upon the concession of the war in Germany Oskar left Germany to escape the USSR onslaught where Oskar clearly would have been executed.
</div><button onclick="myFunction('thirddiv')">after war</button><div id="thirddiv">In 1948 he asked  for compensation of his expenses to the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and was given $15,000. He estimated his expenditures at over $1,056,000, including the costs of camp construction, bribes, and expenditures for black market goods, including food. Oskar emigrated to Argentina in 1949, where he tried raising chickens and then nutria(Large Rat seriously like small dog size), a  animal raised for its fur. When the business went bankrupt.<br> he left his wife and returned to Germany where he had a series of unsuccessful business ventures He declared bankruptcy in 1963 and suffered a heart attack the next year, which led to a month-long stay in hospital. Remaining in contact with many of the Jews he had met during the war including Stern and Pfefferberg, Oskar survived on donations sent by jews he saved from all over the world. He died on 9 October 1974 and is buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion, the only member of the Nazi Party to be honoured in this way. For his work during the war, in 1963 Schindler was named Righteous Among the Nations, an award bestowed by the State of Israel on non-Jews who took an active role to rescue Jews during the Holocaust.</div>

i had problems with the buttons and i also wished i utilized more of my Java knowledge and a bit less CSS and HTML. it was enjoyable to make and killed 2 birds with one stone by completig the task in Humanities giving me much more time then others had for their projects. A summary of this project was hard work and a heap of learning that rsulted in a fantastic website (Mr Edie accused of copying).
